<H2></H2>
<p>This tool allows users to run existing EHLLAPI applications using a variety of interfaces
to Access Client Solutions emulator sessions. Following are details about the supported
interfaces and environments and installation instructions, as well as a
complete list of the known limitations.
<h2>Supported interfaces</h2>
<p>Supported interfaces include the following:
<ul>
<li>Industry Standard EHLLAPI 32-bit</li>
<li>IBM Enhanced EHLLAPI 32-bit</li>
<li>WinHllapi 32-bit</li>
</ul>

<p>Supported non-standard interfaces include the following:
<ul>
<li>IBM Personal Communications PCSAPI Interface</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported environments</h2>

<p>Understand the following notes about supported environments:

<p>The EHLLAPI Bridge runs with IBM Access Client Solutions versions 1.1.6 Update 2 or later.
<p Style="color:green;">Supported environments include  Windows operating systems with Access Client Solutions running in a 32-bit Java virtual machine.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To install the EHLLAPI enablement software on a Windows workstation using
the InstallShield wizard, complete the following steps:
<ol>
<li>The EHLLAPI Bridge installer requires administrative authority, so log in as a member of the Administrators group to perform the installation process.</li>
<li>Double-click ehllapi.exe to launch the installation wizard.</li>
<li>After accepting the license agreement, the installer presents a choice of Complete or Custom install types.

  <br>Custom allows the target install location to be changed from the default directory
    (C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\EHLLAPI), otherwise, it is the same as Complete.</li>

<li>After the installation completes, click Finish to exit the wizard.</li>
</ol>

<p>The installed DLL files have version support.
If you right-click on the DLL file and select the Version tab, you can check the Version and Product level for that DLL file.
</p>
<p>You must install the EHLLAPI enablement software on each machine that will
run native Emulator API programs, unless the system administrator has tools
that can push the binary files out to the client machines, set their System
Paths, and update their registries.

<p>Use the commandline argument <code>/plugin=pcs</code> to start a background instance of Access Client Solutions to be controlled by PCSAPI and EHLLAPI calls. Consult
the GettingStarted document in Access Client Solutions for further details.


<h2>Documentation issues</h2>
<p>
The EHLLAPI Bridge is meant to be a migration tool or API support extension so
legacy code is not lost when moving from IBM Personal Communications.
As such, it is assumed that users of this implementation already
have licensed copies of the APIs from another product. Full EHLLAPI
and PCSAPI documentation is available with IBM Personal Communications.
Should you need further development with EHLLAPI, refer to the documentation delivered with those products. This guide
identifies all known deviations from the original API behaviors.

<h2>Known limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Structured Fields - related functions (120-127) are not supported.</li>
<li>WinHLLAPI Extensions for Asynchronous calls and blocking functions are not supported.</li>
<li>LockPS(60) / LockWindowServices(61) are not supported (used when multiple applications are connected to the same session).</li>
<li>StorageManager(17) is supported for WinHllapi only.</li>
<li>Screen Customizer and the EHLLAPI Bridge are not a supported combination.</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above unsupported options are used by the invoking application,
a message appears notifying the user that the application might not work
as expected.
<p>In addition, the following restrictions apply:

<ul>
<li>SendFile(90) / ReceiveFile(91) is not supported for 5250 sessions.</li>
<li>SetSessionParms(9) DBCS-only parameters EAD/NOEAD, SO/NOSO/SPACESO are not supported.</li>
<li>EXTENDPS / NOEXTENDPS (5250 only) the functions CopyPS,
  CopyPSToString, CopyStringToPS, CopyStringToField, CopyFieldToString, and
  SearchField will always return any messages on line 24 (like EXTENDPS), but
  will never return a 25th line (like NOEXTENDPS).</li>
<li>The parameters SUPER_WRITE, WRITE_SUPER, WRITE_WRITE, WRITE_READ,
  WRITE_NONE, and READ_WRITE will be ignored due to the standard EHLLAPI
  default of only one application can connect to a session at a time.</li>
<li>The parameter NOBLANK will be ignored and the standard EHLLAPI default of BLANK will always be used.</li>
<li>Parameters like KEY$xxxx will be ignored and the standard EHLLAPI default of NOKEY will always be used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding Delays to EHLLAPI Calls</h2>
<P>Because of the nature of TN5250, there are inherent
timing-sensitive code paths that are programmed into the EHLLAPI applications.
When changing systems, or migrating to new emulators, the EHLLAPI application
sometimes needs to be modified to allow more time for processing. This option
was added so delays could be added when modifying the application is not
possible. We recommend modifying the application whenever possible. To enable
EHLLAPI Delay,&nbsp; you must set the environment variable EHLLAPI_DELAY=nnn,
where nnn represents duration of delay in increments of ten milliseconds.
For&nbsp;example, a value of 5 would result in a 50 ms delay <b>before
each</b> EHLLAPI call is executed.&nbsp;

<p>To set the environment variable, take the following steps:

<ol>
<li>On the Windows desktop, right-click This PC and select Properties.</li>
<li>On the left margin Click Advanced system settings.</li>
<li>On the Advanced tab, click Environment Variables...</li>
<li>Under System variables, click New...</li>
<li>In the New System Variable window, type <code>EHLLAPI_DELAY</code>
  in the Variable name field.</li>
<li>In the Variable value field, type a decimal number.</li>
<li>Click OK twice and close the System Properties.</li>
</ol>

<h2>EHLLAPI Tracing</h2>
<p>There is tracing that is specific to EHLLAPI. To enable
tracing, you must set the environment variable EHLLAPI_TRACE=YES. This causes
the Bridge to log all function calls and parameters to c:\debug.log.
<p>To set the environment variable, take the following steps:
<ol>
<li>On the Windows desktop, right-click This PC and select Properties.</li>
<li>On the left margin Click Advanced system settings.</li>
<li>On the Advanced tab, click Environment Variables...</li>
<li>Under System variables, click New...</li>
<li>In the New System Variable window, type <code>EHLLAPI_TRACE</code>
  in the Variable name field.</li>
<li>In the Variable value field, type <code>YES</code>.</li>
<li>Click OK twice and close the System Properties.</li>
</ol>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The log file
is a continuous record, so be sure to delete
the environment variable or set the value to NO when you are finished
tracing. The log file does not have a maximum file size.<p><strong>NOTE</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400">:
Setting the value of environment variable EHLLAPI_TRACE to YES causes the
logging to occur in the location C:\debug.log by default. However, you can also
configure the log file name and path from C:\debug.log to another valid location in the
Windows file system.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 400">To configure the path: In step 6 above, in
place of the value YES, type a value of the format <code>path=&lt;complete_log_path_and_filename&gt;</code> in
the Variable value field. The filename must be <code>debug.log</code>.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 400">Example: To create debug.log in the folder
<code>C:\ehllapiLogging\</code> in a Windows filesystem, as part of step 6 above, set the
EHLLAPI_TRACE variable to <code>path=C:\ehllapiLogging\debug.log</code>
in the Variable value field. Ensure that the folder exists and
has adequate write permissions for logging to occur.</strong>
</p>

<h2> EAL issues</h2>
<p>EAL emulation is meant to be a migration tool or API
support extension so that legacy code is not lost when moving to Access Client Solutions. As
such, it is assumed that users of this implementation already have licensed
copies of the APIs from another product. The EAL documentation is available
with their toolkit.
Depending on how your program uses the EAL Library, it
might be necessary to make conversions to your program to use these extensions.
In addition, some behaviors might differ from the original implementation.</p>


<p>EAL programs must link with ATMAPI32.DLL to run. You can link them via the compiler (implicit linkage) or by specific code (explicit
linkage). Programs written with C, C++, or a similar language and linked
with the import library ATMAPI32.LIB use implicit linkage. Code written
using higher level languages such as Microsoft Visual Basic
or Borland Delphi or C/C++ code that use the Win32 SDK calls to LoadLibrary()
and GetProcAddress() link explicitly. The major difference is that implicitly
linked code does not require the APIs to have the same names; however, explicitly
linked programs do require the APIs to have the same names. This affects how this product is used.

<p>If your program has been linked implicitly by using
  the EAL API directly and by linking with ATMAPI32.LIB, then your program
  should run as is and unmodified, assuming that behavioral differences do not
  affect your logic.

<p>
If your program is linked explicitly, then some
modifications using a simple text replace operation will be required.

<p>If the source for your program is available, then you should convert
it to the new APIs regardless of linkage.

<h2>Tracing</h2>
<p>There is tracing that is specific to the EAL extension code. To enable
tracing, you must set the environment variable UTL_DEBUG=YES. This causes
the Bridge to log all function calls and parameters to utlTrace.log, which
is saved in the same directory as the application.
<p>To set the environment variable, take the following steps:

<ol>
<li>On the Windows desktop, right-click This PC and select Properties.</li>
<li>On the left margin Click Advanced system settings.</li>
<li>On the Advanced tab, click Environment Variables...</li>
<li>Under System variables, click New...</li>
<li>In the New System Variable window, type <code>UTL_DEBUG</code>
  in the Variable name field.</li>
<li>In the Variable value field, type <code>YES</code>.</li>
<li>Click OK twice and close the System Properties.</li>
</ol>

<p>The log file is a continuous record, so be sure to delete the environment
variable when you are finished tracing. The log file has a maximum file size of 16
MB. After this file size is reached the log wraps to the beginning and
starts overwriting older data.

<h2>Known behavioral differences</h2>
<p>Several functions exist that are either exclusive to the competitor
product, or are impractical to implement at this time. Also, there are
certain parameters that are product exclusive, so those parameters will
have default defined behavior. All functions are recognized, but unimplemented
functions will always return UTL_SUCCESS. The following enumerates known
differences in behavior and limitations:
<p>Functions incompatible with Access Client Solutions:
<ul>
<li>AllowUpdate - Allows the emulator to paint the PS in response to a host update after a BlockUpdate call has been made.</li>
<li>BlockUpdate - Prevents the emulator from painting the PS in response to a host update.</li>
<li>HoldHost - Pevents the Host from updating.</li>
<li>ResumeHost - Allows host updates after a HoldHost call has been
made.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the following unsupported Attachmate-specific calls:
<ul>
<li>UTLGetEmulatorPath - always returns UTL_SUCCESS.</li>
<li>UTLGetLayoutName - always returns UTL_SUCCESS.</li>
<li>UTLOpenConfiguration - always returns UTL_SUCCESS.</li>
<li>UTLCloseConfiguration - always returns UTL_SUCCESS.</li>
<li>UTLOpenLayout - always returns UTL_SUCCESS.</li>
<li>UTLExecute - always returns UTL_SUCCESS.</li>
<li>UTLRun_____Macro - always returns UTL_SUCCESS.</li>
<li>UTLRun_____MacroAsync - always returns UTL_SUCCESS.</li>
<li>UTLGetError, UTLShowLastError - always returns UTL_SUCCESS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the following functions with modified or limited behavior:
<ul>
<li>UTLGetConfiguration - returns the name of the currently running and API-connected Access Client Solutions configuration.
<li>UTLGetConnectionStatus - only types UTL_XSTATUS, UTL_CONNECTION, and UTL_ERROR are supported.
<li>UTLGetSessions,UTLListSession - recognize only a difference between
configured and running sessions. UTL_GETCONFIGURED and UTL_GETCONFIGUREDCOUNT
and all other settings will return sessions that are running and are connected to the host.
<li>UTLGetEmulatorVersion - returns the minimum supported version of Access Client Solutions.
<li>UTLRunEmulatorMacro - Runs a previously defined Access Client Solutions macro.</li>
</ul>
